***Prologue - The Book (Draft 2)***

The sound of the keyboard were audible in my quiet room as I stroke each key. I hit enter as I finished my last paperwork for the day.

**Asher:** "Ahh.. I'm so tired...." 

I told myself while sitting on this small, dimly lit apartment, staring blankly at the screen of my old trusted laptop. I kept scrolling on the on the list of odd freelance jobs I have already finished and counting my hard-earned money. *"Damn,it's 10pm."* My fingers resting over the keyboard thinking what should I do next. *sigh* I sighed heavily as I pick up my phone to call my younger brother, Ethan.

**Asher:** "Hey, Ethan. i managed to scrape some money. I am sending them to you now". I said on the phone while clicking on my laptop, sending to money to his account. "Spend it wisely now."
**Ethan:** "You don't have to keep sending me money you know? You should spend some for yourself sometimes." Ethan replied to me with his voice filled with gratitude and excitement.
**Asher:** "Come on Ethan, you are the brighter bulb between the two of us. Of course I have to support you in any way I can right?" I told him as a jest as my grip on the phone tightened.
**Ethan:** "Alright! I will buy as much chips and chocolate as I want tonight!" Ethan jokingly told me over the phone.
**Asher:** "Hey hey, let it last for awhile would you? A month atleast." A moment of silence hung in the air for a moment before I proceed. "Study hard ok? Let me know if there are anything else you need."
**Ethan:** "Will do. Take care of yourself too."

I hung the phone and closed my laptop after.

**Asher:** "I'm hungry. I wonder what's on sale today?"

I stepped out of my apartment into the bustling city streets of Citidal on my way to a convenience store. It's night time, but the city is still so much alive. I looked at the sky, the glistening skyscrapers stretched upward, monuments to human ingenuity. Hundreds to thousands of people rushing on the streets this late at night. High tech streets lights that glow over the pedestrian lane red or green. Cars so fast you wont even hear them coming. The blindingly bright streetlights conquered the darkness of the night. 

My name is Asher. I am a freelancer doing odd jobs in the internet for a living. This is the year 2040, where technology has advanced so much that virtual reality (VR) exists as a norm. Sometime around last year, Dive Technology (DT) was introduced and took the whole world in a storm. It is the technology where you go inside a Dive Pod (DP) and let yourself be immersed in VR. Your real body will go into deep sleep while the machine intercepts all your brain signals to move an avatar instead of your real body. Well, at least that's how they explained it on the news. This is a really interesting time in human development.

The common household normally owns an ordinary DP that can be used by people working remotely to their virtual offices. Some people engage in virtual sports. This technology is most useful for disabled people, enabling them to move around in a virtual environment like any other people. Truly, this is an exciting time in human development. I know right? I am repeating myself! How could I not?!

Citidal stood at the center of DT development, where all new breakthroughs are released in this city before everywhere else. Really, I am lucky to be living here. My odd jobs are earning me good money, enough to send back home. And for real, this is an exciting time in human development....but is that *really* alright? 

People are so used to VR, that the line between reality and dreams have blurred. All of this used to be impossible. Well, there is no use thinking about that with this head of mine, not until my belly is full. Finally, I arrived at the convenience store.

**Asher:** "Let's see what they got....Oh this ones on special. Sushi on peanut sauce? Yuck.... How about this one? Jelly bean flavored noodles? Disgusting. No wonder people don't buy them. Well, good old cup noodles tonight I guess?"

I grabbed a cup noodles on the shelf and headed to the counter. I noticed a sign on the window, so big that only idiots would miss it.

**Asher:** "Escape to the Boundless Realm of Libro - Beta Testing Now Open....or so it says."

When I reached the cashier, I paid for my cup noodles with bottle of soda. I got curious and asked the cashier about the sign.

**Asher:** "Excuse me, do you know anything about that sign?"
**Cashier:** "Oh you mean Libro? Are you interested in it?"
**Asher:** "Kind of."
**Cashier:** "Well, it is the latest VR expereince which was recently launched in Beta Test. They said it is an open book where people can expereince the story instead of reading it. I myself am interested, but I do not have time for it."
**Asher:** "So what should I do to join in?"
**Cashier:** "Ahh wait hold on...Here!" The cashier took out a card with a QR code on it. "Just scan this QR code and it should take you to the website. Just follow the steps from there. Tell me all about it once you get in okay?"
**Asher:** "Alright thanks."

I left the convenience store still staring at the card with the QR code, wondering if I should try it or not.

**Asher:** "Hmm..maybe I can make money with this. Making a blog or guide. If this hits big, I will also hit it big. But that would mean I would not have much time for my jobs....hmmmm..."

I eventually reached my apartment while staring at the card contemplating if I should proceed or not.

**Asher:** "A quick peak shouldn't hurt."

I scanned the QR code, registered on the website and installed the software in his DP. When he tried to launch the program, a message appeared infront of him saying "Unfortunately, you have not been selected for the Beta test. Please await the official release in a week's time."

**Asher:** "Bummer. I was hyped for nothing. At least I can plan ahead before the release. Even Pepper Bae got rich overnight from making a blog back in the day."

I went out of the DP and put the QR code card down. Days went on as per usual, I work my freelance jobs, I earn money, I go to the convenience store to buy food. Just my normal everyday routine. Occasionally going in the VR world to mingle with some online friends, and back to reality again. Since when did my life became so monotonous... Anyway it's been a week and tonight will be the grand opening of Libro. I can't wait to be rich. I sat inside the DP waiting for the time of the grand opening.

**Asher:** "Man my heart is racing. I feel nervous. It's similar to the time before I confessed and got dumped.........I feel dumb waiting here, it's still an hour away." I opened a panel in my DP to look at social media while waiting. I saw all the hype about Libro posted around the social media. "Man its even in the news. This is driving me nuts. I feel stupid giggling like a little girl while waiting...when was the last time I was this excited on something? I can't remember anymore. Even online games doesnt excite me nowadays."

As I kept scrolling on the social media, even famous personalities and political leaders are talking about Libro. They talk about its unique features being an open-started story.

**Asher:** "Seriously? Even the prime minister of another country is going in? All this hyps is just crazy. I hope it wont be a let down.....Opened-started story? What does that even mean? Hmmm.....is this for real? It means the story will proceed depending on how the readers participate in the story? Man this is wild. Whoever thought of this is a genius.....or a complete fool."

As I kept scrolling on the social media, time passed by without me noticing. The clock now at 6:58pm, 2 minutes before the launch. As the countdown for the last minute starts, the whole social media turned silent. At exactly 7:00pm, I dived into the new world head first.
